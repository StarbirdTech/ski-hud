# SkiHUD

Using a phone and accessing information on the slopes is a major inconvenience that skiers need to confront whenever they ski. SkiHUD is a heads- up-display that allows skiers to see information that would normally require significant effort to access, such as speed, location or temperature. In this way, SkiHUD grants a higher level of awareness on the slopes, and allows for easier movement around the mountain.
